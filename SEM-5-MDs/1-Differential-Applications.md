## Newton's Law of Cooling
A hot body at a rate porportional to the difference of temperature of the body and temeprature of its surroundings. This law also translates to a first order differential equation.

1. A cup of coffee was initially boiled at 120°C it was placed in air at 20°C. After 10 minutes the temperature was 80°C. What will be the temperature of coffee after another 10 minutes?

2. A body was heated to 100°C and then placed in a freezer at 0°C. After 30 minutes its temperature was 80°C. How much additional time is required for it to cool to 50°C.

3. A body temperature at a 0°F is placed in a room whose temperature is kept at 100°F. If after 10 minutes the temperature of the body is 25°F find
(a) required time for body to reach a temperature of 50°F and 
(b) the temperature of body after 20 minutes


# Falling Body Problems
Consider a vertically falling body of mass m that is being influenced only by gravity g and an air resistance that is proportional to the velocity of the body. Assume that both gravity and mass remain constant and, for convenience, choose the downward direction as the positive direction.

## Newton's Second Law of Motion
The net force acting on a body is equal to the time rate of change of the momentum of the body: or, for constant mass.

## Electrical Circuit
Two types of electric circuits, first, in which there is no capicitor, the second case when there is no inductor.

1. An RL circuit has an e.m.f given by 4sint (in volts) a resistance of 100 ohms, an inductance of 4 henries and no initial current. Find the current at any time t.

2. An RC circuit has an e.m.f given (in volts) by 400cos2t a resistance of 100 ohms and a capicitance of $10^{-2}$ Farad. Initially there is no charge on the capicitor. Find the current in the circuit at any time t.
